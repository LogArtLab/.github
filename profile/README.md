_**Short introduction**_ - this group has been founded in 2025 from [Laura Nenzi](https://lauranenzi.github.io/), professor at the University of Trieste, and [Simone Silvetti](https://simonesilvetti.github.io/) postdoc at the same university. 
It collects all the scientific artifacts produced during their scientific collaboration started in 2017 when Laura was a postdoc and Simone a phd student.
