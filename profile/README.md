## Hi there 👋

**_Short introduction_** – This group was founded in 2025 by [Laura Nenzi](https://lauranenzi.github.io/), Professor at the University of Trieste, and [Simone Silvetti](https://simonesilvetti.github.io/), Postdoctoral Researcher at the same university. It brings together all the scientific work produced during their collaboration, which began in 2017 when Laura was a postdoc and Simone was a PhD student. The acronym _LogArlLab_ stands for **LOGic and ARTificial intelligence LABoratory**.
